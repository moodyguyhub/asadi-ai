## Template A: Strong Fit → Strategy Consult

**Subject:** Strategy Consult — [Their Constraint] → Scoped Proof

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Good speaking with you. Three takeaways from our call:

1. **Risk you're solving:** [Their answer to Q1 — highest-cost failure mode]
2. **Boundary:** [Their answer to Q2 — data residency / security constraint]
3. **Decision to accelerate:** [Their answer to Q3 — what needs to be faster/safer]

**Next step:** 30-minute Strategy Consult to map these constraints → a scoped proof.

I'll come prepared with:
- Architecture options within your security boundary
- A 1-page scope document
- Measurable success criteria

**Booking link:** https://cal.com/ctoalpha/deep-dive

If you need artifacts before the call (architecture docs, code samples, audit logs), reply with what would help and I'll send them.

## Template B: Uncertain Fit → Fit Check

**Subject:** Fit Check — Confirming Scope

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the conversation. Based on what you shared, I want to confirm scope before we go deeper.

**What I heard:**
- [Brief restatement of their context/problem]

**What I'd need to validate:**

**Next step:** 15-minute Fit Check to confirm this is viable.
